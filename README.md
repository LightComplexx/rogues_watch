<b>Description:</b> Rogue’s watch is a rogue-like game that has you defend your base from incoming waves of
enemies trying to destroy your watch tower, progressing through increasingly difficult levels as
more and more enemies appear to take you down. Two enemy types exist for
rogue’s watch: the bandit and the bird. The bandit is simple and walks straight toward the tower,
but the bird weaves up and down to avoid your attacks. Pull back on your trusty bow to aim and
release to fire arrows at these enemies. Don’t forget to consider the gravity on your projectiles
and try to chain as many enemies as possible to increase your score.
